# Salário líquido - iOS app

This is my first experiment in iOS land :)

It uses a Node.js module that I created to calculate net salaries in Brazil (check [salario-liquido](https://github.com/nicholaspufal/salario-liquido) for more details) which is exposed through a simple service ([salario-liquido-service](https://github.com/nicholaspufal/salario-liquido-service)).

All of this is just part of a pet project.
